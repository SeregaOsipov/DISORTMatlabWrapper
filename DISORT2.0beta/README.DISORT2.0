README:  DISORT version 2.0 (beta release)

This new version of DISORT is being released as a beta version.  While we have
every confidence that it is working correctly, and while it passes all the
test problems, there may still be subtle problems that we would appreciate
hearing about (our e-mail addresses are in DISORT.doc).

The major changes from version 1.2 are:

* Nakajima intensity corrections, allowing use of many fewer streams (NSTR) to
obtain the same intensity accuracy

* a proper lower-boundary bidirectional reflectance option

A version 2.1, incorporating LAPACK replacements for LINPACK, may be issued
soon.
